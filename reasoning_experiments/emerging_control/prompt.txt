Analyse the given information and select the most relevant adjustment.
Pay attention to the validity of your statements!
While changing the extrusion flow rate may seem the best option, it is not always the best option.
    Consider physics, material properties, the current temperature and other things you know about additive manufacturing.
Suggest a single G-code command for the most effective parameter adjustment, if an adjustment is needed.

**Output the gcode command in the gcode tag in this format: ```gcode <command>```**
    No other information should be within the gcode tag. Do not change lines either.
    If a command is not needed, just say ```gcode no_command```.
    If a command is needed, provide the G-code command within the ```gcode <command>``` tags.
