            "answer": "Thermal conductivity significantly impacts the 3D printing process, especially in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). For successful FDM, the plastic filament material must melt uniformly to create a precise, well-formed product. A material's thermal conductivity determines how efficiently heat transfers through it; if it's too low, the material won't melt evenly and can result in poor print quality. Conversely, if the thermal conductivity is too high, the filament could melt too quickly, causing similar issues. Therefore, understanding and accurately managing thermal conductivity is crucial in FDM 3D printing."

            "answer": "A heated print bed is crucial in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing because it helps to prevent warping. Warping can occur when the material being printed cools down too quickly and contracts, causing the corners of the object to lift off the print bed. By maintaining a consistent temperature on the print bed, the material cools down at a slower, more controlled rate, thus reducing the risk of warping."

            "question": "Why does ABS material warp in 3D printing?",
            "answer": "ABS or Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene material tends to warp in 3D printing due to its high shrinkage rate when cooled. When different parts of the print cool at different rates, it causes the material to warp or curl, especially at the corners or edges of the product. This is a particular issue with ABS because it is a thermoplastic that softens and becomes moldable when heated and then solidifies again when cooled."

            "answer": "The heat resistance of a 3D printed object greatly depends on the type of filament used in the Fused Deposition Modeling process. For example, PLA (Polylactic Acid) has relatively low heat resistance and may deform at temperatures above 60\u00b0C. On the other hand, filaments like ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and Nylon have higher heat resistance, typically withstanding temperatures up to 100\u00b0C and 180\u00b0C respectively. There are also special high-performance filaments like PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) that can resist temperatures up to 250\u00b0C.

It refers to the temperature at which a material changes from a hard and relatively brittle state into a molten or rubbery state. In Fused Deposition Modeling, understanding Tg is crucial because the material must be heated above this temperature to be extruded appropriately through the nozzle.

A correct feed rate will result in a sufficient amount of filament being provided to produce solid, well-formed layers. If the feed rate is too high, too much material will be extruded, causing blobs and deformities in the printed object.
