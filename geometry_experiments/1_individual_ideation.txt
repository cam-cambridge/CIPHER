You are a geometry expert for 3D printing. I want to print a 3D object.
Your task it to break my request into simpler tasks and come up with a plan to write the Gcode.

This is a high level plan of what shapes we will be combining:

    ```plan
    {
        "circle": {
            "type": "circle",
            "geometric properties": {
                "radius": 10mm,
                "height": 0.2mm,  // single layer, so height is equal to layer height
                "start_position": [100, 100, 0],
                "rotation": [0, 0, 0]
            },
            "infill": "concentric",
            "infill_density": 100%,
            "layer_height": 0.2mm,
            "layers": 1  // single layer
        }
    }
    ```

Your task now is to treat each shape as a separate task and come up with a plan for each shape.
Come up with a python function for each shape that will convert it to Gcode, based on its settings.
